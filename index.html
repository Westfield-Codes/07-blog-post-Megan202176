<h1>How I learned to fly</h1>
<h2>Opportunities in aviation</h2>

   <h3>How it started - </h3>
  <p>“I’ve flown a plane before” that was the sole reason I first wanted to fly. I first learned the basics of flight in eighth grade. I owe my interest in aviation to the “Wright Flight” program in middle school. I had no prior knowledge or experience in aviation, none of my family members have ever been involved with flying. But I decided to join the program with the intention of being able to say “I’ve flown a plane before”.</p>
  <h3>What is “Wright Flight”? - </h3>
  <p>“Wright Flight” was an afterschool program at Westfield Middle School, run by volunteer teachers and members of the organization. It was after school once a week explaining fundamentals of flight, history of flight, and even using flight simulators that were brought in. After 10 weeks of classes, there was a flight day. You would partner up and be assigned a flight instructor from the flight school, Fly Lugu, at Barnes. Our flight was to Turner's Falls and it was an hour round trip, switching partners half way. After my first flight I joined Wright Flight 2, which had classes at Barnes every weekend. </p>

  <h3>My goal - </h3>
  <p>After Wright Flight two, I decided I wanted to continue with flying. I now fly every weekend at Northampton airport in their flight school. It's one on one lessons with your instructor, often around an hour of flight time. Either doing maneuvers like stalls or steep turns, or going to Barnes to practice ATC communications. My goal is to earn my private pilots license, which requires 40 hours of flight time, with various different solo and cross country requirements. Afterwards you need to pass a FAA written test and practical exam flying.</p>
  <h3>Requirments - </h3>
  <p>A total of 40 hours, although most students take around 60 hours.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Three hours of cross country flight training</li>
    <li>Three hours of night training</li>
    <ul>
      <li>One cross country flight over 100 nautical miles</li>
      <li>10 takeoff and 10 landings to a full stop</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Three hours of training dedicated to manoeuvres</li>
    <li>Ten hours of solo flight training</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Five hours of solo cross country time</li>
      <li>One solo cross country flight of 150 nautical miles, with 3 full stop landings.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
